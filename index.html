    <h3>Thoughs on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is a web development strategy that begins with developing a core of basic functionality and content that will work for every user, regardless of the device or browser capabilities. It then supplements this with extra features and enhancements for those users with modern browsers or higher capability devices. This makes the core experience available to everyone while providing an enhanced experience for those with better technology.
  The importance of progressive enhancement in modern web development is that it enables the creation of inclusive, resilient, and future-proof websites. By starting with a basic, functional edition of a website and then gradually adding enhancements, developers are able to make their work accessible to users with older browsers, slower connections, or assistive technologies. This approach also underpins the web accessibility and usability guidelines, leveling the playing field of the web for all users. Progressive enhancement also enables websites to work better across diverse environments, for instance, on mobile phones or where bandwidth is low
  For further reading on this topic, I recommend this article from Smashing Magazine<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/" class="progressive-enhancement-link" target="_blank">Progressive Enhancement: What It Is, And How To Use It?</a> It provides a detailed explanation of progressive enhancement, its benefits, and practical examples of how to implement it in web development.</p>

    <h3>Website Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>Creating the Destiny 2 promotional website was a rewarding experience that blended my passion for the game with web development skills. The site successfully delivers a clean, user-friendly design with engaging content and brand-consistent visuals, including a functional contact form. However, I identified areas for improvement, such as enhancing mobile responsiveness, adding interactive features like videos or quizzes, and optimizing SEO and performance. Feedback from peers helped refine my approach, teaching me the value of responsive design, interactivity, and iterative improvements. Moving forward, I plan to implement these enhancements to create a more polished and immersive experience for visitors. This project was both enjoyable and educational, and I look forward to further refining it.

  <h3>Image Optimization Thoughts</h3>
  <p>According to web.dev, even small page load times can lead to higher bounce rates and lost conversions. Faster sites mean more engagement, better SEO and more revenue. Since images are the heaviest part of the page, optimising them is a quick win for performance. web.dev and Kinsta both stress the importance of using modern formats like WebP or AVIF which offer better compression without sacrificing quality. Tools like Squoosh, ImageMagick or CMS plugins can automate compression while balancing file size and clarity.
    Serving images based on device resolution (using srcset) stops unnecessary data usage. Lazy loading offscreen images (via the loading="lazy" attribute) speeds up initial page load. These techniques mean users only download what they need, when they need it.
    Optimising images isn’t just about shrinking files – it’s about usability, accessibility and conversions. By using modern formats, smart compression and lazy loading developers can boost site performance big time.
